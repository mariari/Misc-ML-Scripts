* Misc-Haskell-Scripts

This sub-directory isn't the /most/ interesting, however there may be
gems if one is newer to the Haskell programming language.

Some notable files are
1. =Sexp=
   - This Includes a library which can automatically serialize and
     =desearlize= Haskell code into S-expressions
   - This provides a much better way to structure compilers than the
     traditional ML style sum type as it's extensible and offers a
     good serialization and abstraction mechanism
2. =Standardlibrary=
   - This includes a module which lets one trace their Haskell
     programs.
3. =Life.hs=
   - This is code adapted from a 5~ line APL program to
     simulate the life game
4. =Free.hs=
   - Playing and useage of the Free Monad
5. =data-structures/=
   - Various data structures made in Haskell
6. =interesting-problems.hs=
   - This file is for code solutions to small but interesting problems
7. =Modern-compilers=
   - A Haskell solution to "Modern Compilers in ML"
