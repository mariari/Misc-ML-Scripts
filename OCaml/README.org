Some notable files are

   - a mini interpreter in OCaml
2. =berlin-pipeline.mli=

   - A real version will be given in Haskell for those curious, I just
     have to unbitrot it
3. =nameless.ml=
   - Implements da brujin indices
4. =nameless-boehm-beraducci.ml=
   - Reimplements nameless, but using rank 2 F_Ï‰
5. =nameless-final-first.ml=
   - tries to do nameless-bb again but this time with module functors,
     this is the first flawed attempt
