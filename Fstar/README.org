* Misc-F^{★}-Scripts
This directory contains a bunch of F^{★} work along with helpers

** Notable files
1. _=fun=_
   1. =Automaton=
      - This proves the correctness of the =four-direction-machine=
      - Later an isomorphism will be proved about this machine, and
        the =turn-machine=
   2. =Implementations=
      - Working through Implementing Functional Languages: a
        tutorial in F^{★}.
        + This books includes the =template-machine=, =G-machine=,
          =TIM-machine=, etc.
      - See the =README= in that directory for more information
   3. =Token=
      - Implements a basic token system with burn, mint, and transfer
        maintaining certain invariants.
2. =Interopt/=
   + See the =README= for that folder
3. =cache-fstar-source.lisp=
   + This lisp file will cache F^{★} code recursively for you, so call it
     once on a file via
     #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
       (fix-script:generate-cache "file.fst")
     #+END_SRC
     * *Probably* has to be in the same directory as the file, as F^{★}
       can be rather finicky with names.
     * This will also cache your standard library
   + This makes F^{★} easier to use!
