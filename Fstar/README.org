* Misc-F^{★}-Scripts
This directory contains a bunch of F^{★} work along with helpers

** Notable files
- _Making F^{*} easier to run_
  1. _=fun=_
     1. _=Automaton=_
        - This proves the correctness of the =four-direction-machine=
        - Later an isomorphism will be proved about this machine, and
          the =turn-machine=
     2. _=Implementations=_
        - Working through Implementing Functional Languages: a
          tutorial in F^*.
          + This books includes the =template-machine=, =G-machine=,
            =TIM-machine=, etc.
        - See the =README= in that directory for more information
  2. _=Interopt/=_
     + See the =README= for that folder
  3. =cache-fstar-source.lisp=
     + This lisp file will cache F^{★} code recursively for you, so call it
       once on a file via
       #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
         (fix-script:generate-cache "file.fst")
       #+END_SRC
       * *Probably* has to be in the same directory as the file, as F^{★}
         can be rather finicky with names.
       * This will also cache your standard library
